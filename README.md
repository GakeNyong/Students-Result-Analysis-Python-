# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing student results to calculate total scores, grades, and comments.
The analysis is performed using Python's Pandas library in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 177 rows and 7 columns:
- Student Name: The name of the student
- Class: The class of the student
- Exam Score: The score obtained by the student in the exam
- Midterm Score: The score obtained by the student in the midterm
- CA Score: The score obtained by the student in the continuous assessment

# Analysis and Findings
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Data Import and Cleaning: The dataset is imported into a Pandas DataFrame and checked for data types and missing values.
2. Total Score Calculation: The total score for each student is calculated by adding the exam, midterm, and CA scores.
3. Grade Assignment: Grades are assigned to each student based on their total score using a lambda function.
4. Comment Assignment: Comments are assigned to each student based on their total score using a lambda function.
5. Grade Distribution: The number of students by grade is calculated using the value_counts function.

# Grade and Comment Criteria
- Grade A: 80-100
- Grade B: 70-79
- Grade C: 60-69
- Grade D: 50-59
- Grade E: 40-49
- Grade F: Below 39

# Code Functions
- Lambda Function for Grade Assignment: A lambda function is used to assign grades based on the total score. The function takes the total score as input and returns the corresponding grade.
- Lambda Function for Comment Assignment: A lambda function is used to assign comments based on the total score. The function takes the total score as input and returns the corresponding comment.
- Value Counts Function: The value_counts function is used to calculate the number of students by grade.
- Rounding Function: The round function is used to round the exam scores to 2 decimal places.
